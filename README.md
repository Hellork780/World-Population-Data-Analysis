# World-Population-Data-Analysis

The dataset contains population data for 234 countries/territories along with their respective details. Below is an overview of the dataset:

Key Columns in the Dataset:

Rank: The ranking of a country based on its population.

CCA3: The three-letter country code.

Country/Territory: The name of the country or territory.

Capital: The capital city of the country.

Continent: The continent where the country is located.

Population Data (1970-2022): Population figures recorded for multiple years (2022, 2020, 2015, 2010, 2000, 1990, 1980, and 1970).

Area (km²): Total land area of the country in square kilometers.

Density (per km²): Population density, calculated as people per square kilometer.

Growth Rate: The annual population growth rate.

World Population Percentage: The percentage of the world's total population that each country contributes.

Preliminary Observations:

Population Growth: The dataset provides population data across different years, allowing for an analysis of population trends and growth rates.

Diverse Density Levels: Some countries have high population densities (e.g., American Samoa - 222.5 people/km²), while others are more sparsely populated (e.g., Algeria - 18.85 people/km²).

Largest Countries: The dataset includes land area data, making it possible to compare population vs. land area (e.g., China and India have high populations but vastly different land sizes).

Continental Breakdown: Countries are categorized by continents, allowing for a regional comparison of population distribution.
